# Diary

Here I just want to draw some conclusions on the days and the outcome of all the experience I am living here in Chicago and in the FermiLab 

# 2 August 2024

I have to say things are moving really slowly, I am still not able to access the FPGA wich is the main motivation why I'm here.

Chris looks like a good guy, he calls me many times during the day, but does not make to much effort to help me, mostly he just stays at home and make zoom calls to me and the other guy here, David. 

Also David is quite strange, talks little, works a lot. I never see him with other people and probably if it wasn't for Chris and the fact that we are in the same project he wouldn't even have come to present himself. 

The place where I am now is quite solitary, there is a long hall with many offices on the side, most of them are empty and there is a lot of space unused. It looks like a very luxurius place but without anyone to populate it. 

I started using GitHub, this is one of the goals I have for myself. I do not really know why, I just feel that I like to use these instruments, like GitHub, Drive and so on. I would really like to understand better some things like Servers, Hubs and so on. 
Many times I'd asked my self if it was a passion of mine or wether if it was something more like I do wanna have my parents and the people around me to like me, but now that my mind is free from all the external inputs that I receive when I'm in Bologna I just feel like I am curious about this stuff.
