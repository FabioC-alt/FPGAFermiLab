# FPGA for Signal Detection

 This project focuses on the RedPitaya board in order to perform signal detection fot the GQuEST experiment at FermiLab in the context of my summer internship, for my purpouses I will focus on experimenting with the FPGA, the Vivado environment and Pynq environment.

## Technical Goals (RedPitaya)
- [x] Establish Serial Connection
- [x] Boot using Picocom
- [x] Update the SD card OS
- [x] Blinking Led Project
- [x] Analog Echo Project 
- [x] DMA demo Project
- [x] FFT Accelerator Project (DMA data in)
- [ ] Spectrum Analyzer (ADC in PS)
- [ ] CS Accelerator (DMA input)
- [ ] Correlator (2x ADC in)
- [ ] Accellerator

## FFT Accelerator
- [x] Sin Wave
- [x] Sin Wave with real number
- [x] FFT sw
- [x] FFT hw
- [x] Double-sided Spectrum
- [ ] Amplitude and Udig

## Technical Goals (4x2 board)
- [ ] Establish Serial Connection
- [ ] Boot using Picocom
- [ ] Update the SD card OS
- [ ] Blinking Led Project
