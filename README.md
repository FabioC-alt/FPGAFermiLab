# FPGA for Signal Detection

 This project focuses on the RedPitaya board in order to perform signal detection fot the GQuEST experiment at FermiLab in the context of my summer internship, for my purpouses I will focus on experimenting with the FPGA, the Vivado environment and Pynq environment.

## Technical Goals
- [x] Establish Serial Connection
- [x] Boot using Picocom
- [x] Update the SD card OS
- [ ] Deploy the precompiled bit stream from the dspsandbox project
- [ ] Accellerator

## Theoretical Goals
- [ ] Understanding what to do
- [ ] Generating the signal with the noise
- [ ] Using it to put the FPGA on
