# Notes on Rookie Book

## Basics Concepts
The first concept is the **beam**:
the beam is a focused group of particles all traveling in the same over-all direction. In the FNAL the goal is to monitor the beam intensity and the accelerator chain in order to know when and where the beam is lost. 
The measure unit is "eV" also called electron-volt.
The **acceletor** aims to increse the kinetic energy (eV) of a beam particles.

The beam travels in a longitudinal direction. 
The beams are accelerated using **RF cavities**, while to control the **Magnets** control the beam trajectory.
**RF** stands for Radio Frequency, which are capable of accelerating the beams. When we change the direction of a beam particol we are **bending** the beam.
## Types of Accelerators

1. Linear Accelerator \
    Also called *linac* are mainly composed of RF cavities.

2. Synchroton Accelerator \
    All the circular accelearator are known as **Synchroton Accelerator**. This is becaus the magnet system and the RF are syncronized. The current flowing in these components increases for all in a controlled manner.

    In the RF Cavity is where the beam receive a kick increase, everytime the beams goes througth the cavity its speed increase.
    Two important concepts are:
    - **Ideal Orbit**: is the path througth the center of the magnets.
    - **Closed Orbit**: is the beam path that returnsn to the same point on every revolution around a circular machin.
3. Beamlines \
    In some occasions we may need to change the accelerator these job is performed by the **beamlines**.

    When we insert a beam inside a new machine we perform an **extraction** from the older accelerator and an **injection** into the new accelerator.

All the accelerator are controlled by the **Main Control Room (MCR)**.
